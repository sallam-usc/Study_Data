# Neuronal Population Models Reveal Specific Linear Conductance Controllers Sufficient to Rescue Preclinical Disease Phenotypes
We show how different methods based on classical ML algorithms and heuristics are used to identify unique parameteric transformations to match multivariate distributions in feature space. 
Specifically we applied these frameworks within the context of identifying a unique ion channel target (parameter) modulation that will transform a heterogenous population of disease phenotype towards healthy phenotype.

# Study Highlights 

What is the current knowledge of the topic?

Pre-clinically, potential drug candidates are screened for alleviation of certain in vitro electrophysiological features. Population based modeling is widely used to represent intrinsic variability of these features. However, the means by which these drugs can address recovery in terms of divergence of a heterogenous population is neglected and unexplored.

What question did this study address?

Can computational models of striatal medium spiny neurons, which capture statistical relations between electrophysiological features of Wild-type and Huntington’s Disease phenotypes, and their respective model parameter sets provide a direction of ion channel target modulation for phenotypic recovery across a heterogenous population?

What does this study add to our knowledge?

The methods presented here help identify ‘one’ virtual drug or a profile of target modulations that transform disease phenotypes to healthy phenotypes in terms of both heterogeneity and divergence of the model population.

How this might change clinical pharmacology and therapeutics? 

Complementing pre-clinical experiments with these computational methods can be used to screen potential therapeutic targets. Additionally, also identifying synergistic drugs that align with the target modulation profile to alleviate disease phenotypes in terms of both heterogeneity and divergence at the population level becomes possible.
